This are my personal dotfiles for GNU/Linux, as well as useful scripts, located mostly in the =sc/= folder. Some of them are part of [[https://github.com/gerardet46/my-flybinds][my build of flybinds]], which are located in =sc/flybinds=.

It also includes my Emacs config!

** Installation of my system
You can also install a new arch (or artix) fresh system with my dotfiles and programs list (*progs.csv*). This uses [[https://larbs.xyz][LARBS]], by Luke Smith, to install programs and dotfiles to build the entire desktop environment.

To do so, we just need to execute the file =run-larbs.sh=, which downloads the /larbs.sh/ script and manipulates it with some defaults. Then, run as *root* the following:
#+begin_src shell
  curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gerardet46/dotfiles/master/run-larbs.sh
  sh run-larbs.sh
#+end_src

*** Dependencies
To do it, jo need to have this dependencies installed:
- =curl=
- A fresh arch/artix installation (no user creation needed)

** Installation of dotfiles
Just clone this repo in the *HOME* folder. Everything should work out of the box.
#+begin_src shell
  git clone https://github.com/gerardet46/dotfiles ~/
#+end_src

*** Hooks for Arch Linux
If you are in an Arch linux based distro, you can prepare the =.config/pacman-hooks= executing (you will need to do this every time you create/delete/rename a /pacman hook/).
#+begin_src shell
  .config/set-config.sh
#+end_src

** Notes
- Some configs are using my library [[https://github.com/gerardet46/gcolors][gcolors]] to set global colors for all the system, so the window manager may crash if you don't have those installed. This are the script files that uses colors, for example =$COL_BG_0=, so maybe you can search for those files containing color definitions by executing =grep -R "COL_" * .[^.]*.=
- For setting up Emacs, you can read the literate config (actually the README.org) in the =.emacs.d= folder.
- The file =copyconfigs.sh= is used by me to rsync all the configs I need to upload.
